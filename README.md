# Application Development Sandbox

A playground for Flask, Dash, Shiny applications, APIs, Cloud architecture. Some elements of front-end, interactive data visualization, databases, DevOps.


## Microservices with Docker, Flask, and React

A course by [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io) which fits perfectly with my current needs. Instead of deploying on AWS, I will be using Google Cloud Platform and corresponding services (e.g. Cloud Run, AppEngine, Endpoints).

### FastAPI
Experiments with the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework for developing RESTful APIs. The features should help speed up the development in contrast with doing everything manually in Flask.

```bash
pip install fastapi  # the package
pip install uvicorn  # production server
```

## Experimenting with Streamlit dashboards

I was recently suggested a cool new framework, which should be easier and faster than Dash, streamlit. Here are a few resources which should be helpful:
